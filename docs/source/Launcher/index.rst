F.A.Q.
======

How to change the save location
-------------------------------

1. Create a new ``text document``.
2. Include the following code in to the text document:

.. code-block:: none

   SET sPath=%appdata%
   SET AppData=[Location]
   MyM-Launcher.exe
   SETAppdata=%sPath%
   
3. Change [Location] to your custom directory (For example: ``D:\Program Files (x86)\MyMLauncher``).
4. Save the document as ``MyM-Launcher.bat`` in the same directory as the ``MyM-Launcher.exe``.
5. Run the ``MyM-Launcher.bat`` to download and start the modpacks.

REI Minimap migration
---------------------
These are the steps to migrate the REI's waypoints from FTB Launcher to the MYM Launcher.

1. Open a new window and navigate to your FTB Install Folder

   * You can find the folder by starting the FTB Launcher and pressing options.

2. From the FTB Install folder navigate to [FTB Install Folder]\Monster\minecraft\mods\rei_minimap.
3. In another window, navigate to %AppData%\.mineyourmind\instances\MyM-FTB-Monster\minecraft\mods\rei_minimap

   * You should be able to copy this entire path to your navigation bar.

4. Copy all the .points files from `[FTB Install Folder]\Monster\minecraft\mods\rei_minimap to %AppData%\.mineyourmind\instances\MyM-FTB-Monster\minecraft\mods\rei_minimap`.
5. You might have to rename some files depending on what method you use to connect to the servers

   * If you have been connecting to the lobby and would like to use direct connect on the MYM Launcher, rename your files to have the prefix "monster-new.mineyourmind.net" ``monster.mineyourmind.net.DIM0.points`` **->** ``monster-new.mineyourmind.net.DIM0.points``
   * Other Examples: ``monster-new.mym.li.DIM0.points`` **->** ``monster-new.mineyourmind.net.DIM0.points``
